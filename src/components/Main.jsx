                  <p> Weâ€™d love for you to come learn something new, take the things you love (sports, art, traveling, dogs!) or care about (poverty, sea level rise, hunger) and combine them with techonology to make something different, something cool, or something to improve the world.</p>
                  <p>It'll be sweet. We Promise.</p>
